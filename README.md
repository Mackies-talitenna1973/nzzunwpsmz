OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 The Ballad of Wallis Island and honestly, I'm still processing. Like, what even was that ending? Did they seriously just leave us hanging like that? I swear these writers are just toying with us at this point. And the main character, Jane or whatever—man, she’s got layers but also makes you wanna scream, you know what I mean? One minute you’re rooting for her, next minute you’re like, girl, what are you doing??

Also, the soundtrack. Oh my god, was it just me or did the music not quite fit in half the scenes? Felt like they just took random tracks and slapped them in. I didn't even know whether to laugh or cringe. But you know, despite all that, I kind of weirdly liked it? Don’t ask me why, I’m just as confused.

> Have you managed to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   yet? I promise it’s one of those where you’re like why am I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 this? the whole time, but still can’t stop 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it anyway, haha. The island setting though—definitely dreamy. Almost makes me want to take a vacation, but then I remember I’ve got laundry to do and kids to pick up. Reality checks, am I right?

Oh, and can we talk about that twist? Like, I saw parts of it coming but then they just threw in this curveball that left me gobsmacked. Seriously, how did nobody see that one character being shady all along? I feel so bamboozled. Why do I even try to guess the plot twists anymore? Guess I should just sit back with my popcorn and enjoy the ride.

# print(I don't even code, what is this???)

Anyway, despite the madness, totally worth the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. It’s one of those you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and instantly feel the need to rant about it to someone, so here we are haha. Alright, I need coffee or a nap. Maybe both? Can't adult anymore today. Chat later?
